Utilities for computing expansions of group-invariant Hermitian-symmetric
polynomials of the form
```
Φ_Γ(z, \bar{z}) = (1 - \prod_{γ∈Γ}(1 - \langle γz, z \rangle_b),
```
where Γ is a finite cyclic subgroup of U(a, b), and
```
\langle z, w \rangle_b
:= \sum_{j = 1}^a z_j \overline{w_j}
- \sum_{j = a + 1}^{a + b} z_j \overline{w_j}.
```

Notes
-----
Question: What do the generators look like for Γ ⊂ SU(1, 2) or Γ ⊂ SU(2, 1)?
Suppose we have a 3 x 3 diagonal generator with powers of a primitive root of
unity along the diagonal, i.e. something of the form given in (5) in [1]. Is
the group generated by this matrix a subgroups of SU(1, 2) or SU(2, 1), or
neither?

We should be able to answer this question by writing some code, because we know
what condition matrices must satisfy in order for us to know they live in SU(a,
b).

Let I_n be the n x n identity matrix. Let I_{ab} be the square matrix with I_a
in the top left hand corner and -I_b in the bottom right hand corner. Then we
must have
```
A I_{ab} A* = I_{ab}.
```
